# Hi there, here Pablo 👋😁

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I am a self-taught developer with a strong focus on learning Computer Science/Software Engineering concepts. I am particularly passionate about performance optimization, Clean Code principles, and Test Driven Development. Throughout my journey as a Software Developer, I have acquired knowledge through various channels including books, online courses, blogs, and YouTube. However, my current favorite method of learning is through reading books and exploring official technology documentation.

During my leisure time, I find great joy in reading engaging books and cherishing moments with my loving family, including my sons and wife.

# Hi there, here Pablo 👋😁

![Profile Views](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=pablohdzvizcarra)

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I am a self-taught developer with a strong focus on working with Microservices architectures. I am particularly passionate about performance optimization, Clean Code principles, and Test Driven Development. Throughout my journey as a Software Developer, I have acquired knowledge through various channels including books, online courses, blogs, and YouTube. However, my current favorite method of learning is through reading books and exploring official technology documentation.

Working in Agile environments where clean code practices are valued and appreciated is something that truly excites me. I strive to bring a more professional and efficient approach to the teams I work with, enabling them to respond quickly and effectively to any changes that arise.

During my leisure time, I find great joy in reading engaging books and cherishing moments with my loving family, including my sons and wife.
